            <P> My this project I collaged how I see my body, mind, and soul using Photoshop. I did this by looking through photos on the internet and collaging them on Photoshop. I really struggled with the mind portion of the project. I think if anyone is a Marvel fan they can tell that I watched the Doctor Strange 2 trailer before I started the mind portion! My mind is always changing and I didn’t know how to portray that therefore, portals. I also feel like I’m never in control in my mind, like my emotions and feeling control me even though I try to keep control. I was also really scared that I was going to look bad if I added a lot more. 
            My other to pieces are more simple and less hectic. But then again my mind is hectic. To me my work seems very literal but I guess to someone else it’s not. After the back and forth of how I felt I stepped away from the work and 2 hours later I really felt it represented me. I feel more confident about my work than I did at the beginning of the project that’s for sure.
