    <h1>What I Did Last Wednesday Part 3</h1>
    <p>In the series finale of the Adventures of Cat, Cat will be showing their box collection. 
        Cat's collection of boxes always begans and ends during Christmas time. Cat 
        loves the variety of boxes that are around the house during Christmas. Below is a 
        Cat sitting in a festive box with a penguin on the box. Cat rated the box a solid 6/10,
        Cat didn't fit in it completely so it lost some points but the festivness of the box helped. </p>

    <p>The next photo is of Cat in another box the Christmas tree. This box is a lot 
        less festive than the last one. However, Cat fit better in this box. To quote Cat 
        "You can't go wrong with an Amazon Box!". It was a good nap spot for Cat!
        Cat decided to rate this box a 8/10.  </p>
