    <h1>What I Did Last Wednesday Part 1</h1>
    <p>Last Wednesday was the most Wednesday that 
        ever Wednesday-ed. I woke up on that Wednesday 
        and realized my bed was gone! I suspected my cat 
        must have stolen it. My cat loves human stuff so 
        I assumed they must have stole it to add to 
         their collection. After naming my cat, "Cat", 
         Cat had a tendency to act human. The first occurance
          of my cat stealing my things was during Christmas. Cat
        had stolen my elf hat and determined it was their's. Below
         is evidence of Cat red handed.</p>

    <p> Other occurance of this happening was the Wednesday 
        before last Wednesday. I found Cat destorying a basket 
        in my room. I told Cat that their collection of human 
        stuff was under the basket so it makes sense that Cat was 
    digging through the basket to find their collection. Once again the evidence is below. </p>
